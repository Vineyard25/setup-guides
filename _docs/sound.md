## 1. Before church

### Line check [09:30]
- [ ] One-by-one, do a 'line check' (check you are getting signal from each instrument & microphone)
	* Ask the musician to play the loudest they will during the service, and adjust the gain until the incoming signal shows in the yellow (red is too high)
	* Note: This will *not* relate to instrument sound from the speakers
	* Note: This *will* affect the band members in-ears

> **Checklist for issues during line check**
><br> - Is the channel muted?
><br> - Is there a mute group active?
><br> - Is the DI box set up correctly? ([dual](/assets/images/di-settings-dual.jpg) &#124;[mono - input side](/assets/images/di-settings-mono-1.jpg) &#124; [mono - output side](/assets/images/di-settings-mono-2.jpg))
><br> - Are both ends of the cable connected properly?
><br> - Is the instrument generating any signal?
><br> - Is the gain on the channel very low?

### Sound check & band practice [09:40]
- [ ] Hand out wireless IEMs to musicians
	* If you have more than 5 people on the band, use wired IEMs for drummer & keyboardist
- [ ] Make sure the DCA groups (last tab) are on +0db and not on mute
- [ ] Make sure the master volume (penultimate tab) is near +0db
- [ ] One-by-one, ask band member to play:
	- [ ] Re-check gain level
	- [ ] Bring up volume
	- [ ] EQ by __reducing__ - not increasing - frequencies 
- [ ] Once ready, give the worship leader the green light to practice!

> ##### Warning
>
> If you you change gain or EQ on a channel it **will** affect in-ears.
> <br>Warn the band first!
