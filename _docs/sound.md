## üéöÔ∏è Step 2: Line Check

- [ ] Load the ‚ÄúReset‚Äù preset
- [ ] Tell the band **not** to put in-ears in yet
- [ ] For each instrument:
  1. Un-mute
  2. Check signal is coming through
  3. Ask them to play loudly, then **adjust gain** (red = too high)

**Troubleshooting if no signal:**
- Is the channel or group muted?
- Is a mute group active?
- Are all cables fully connected?
- Is the DI box set up correctly?

- Is a strange EQ active?

## üéõÔ∏è Step 3: Sound Check

- [ ] Un-mute DCAs (last iPad tab) and set to 0dB  
- [ ] Un-mute Master (penultimate tab) and set to 0dB  
- [ ] Go through each band member:
  1. **Volume** ‚Äî bring up main fader
  2. **EQ** ‚Äî reduce frequencies (don‚Äôt boost them)
- [ ] Tell the band they can now put in their in-ears

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Changing gain or EQ will affect in-ears. Always warn the band first.

## üéõÔ∏è Step 4: During the service

- [ ] Connect to the bluetooth and play the [Pre-service Playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6eFHoqPnNc89xkq8eM78Bj?si=982df845c1184576)
- [ ] At 10:55 be ready for the kids church announcement
- [ ] At 11:00 gradually fade out the music when the host is ready
- [ ] After the talk, gradually fade in (quietly!) a calm, without-vocals worship playlist [like this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7dqiLIfuehHZvHQdHoHEaF?si=KRahHrFIRtqxoYzP1GUZFg)
