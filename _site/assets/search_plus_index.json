    "body": "1. Jekyll collections Jekyll’s [collections][15] is supported to organize the pages in a more fine-grained manner, e.g., collections: pages: output: true sort_by: date permalink: /:collection/:year-:month-:day-:title:output_ext others: output: true sort_by: date permalink: /:collection/:year-:month-:day-:title:output_ext An optional ordered_collections key can be added to _config.yaml to control the order of collections in the sidebar: ordered_collections: - posts - pages - others If not specified, the order of collections would be decided by Jekyll. Note that the key posts is a special collection that indicates the _posts pages of Jekyll. 2. Cover image inside pages The jekyll-gitbook theme supports adding a cover image to a specific page by adding a cover field to the page metadata: --- title: Page with cover image author: Vineyard25 date: 2022-05-24 category: Jekyll layout: post + cover: /assets/jekyll-gitbook/dinosaur.gif --- The effect can be previewed at: https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/jekyll/2022-05-24-page_cover.html 3. Alerts Tips Using a {: .block-tip} attribute: &gt; ##### TIP &gt; &gt; This guide is last tested with @napi-rs/canvas^0.1.20, so make sure you have &gt; this or a similar version after installation. {: .block-tip } TIP This guide is last tested with @napi-rs/canvas^0.1.20, so make sure you have this or a similar version after installation. Warnings Using a {: .block-warning} attribute: &gt; ##### WARNING &gt; &gt; Be sure that you're familiar with things like async/await and object destructuring &gt; before continuing, as we'll be making use of features like these. {: .block-warning } WARNING Be sure that you’re familiar with things like async/await and object destructuring before continuing, as we’ll be making use of features like these. Dangers Using a {: .block-danger} attribute: &gt; ##### DANGER &gt; &gt; You cannot delete an ephemeral message. {: .block-danger } DANGER You cannot delete an ephemeral message. 4. Wide tables Wide tables need to be wrapped into a div with class table-wrapper to make sure it displayed as expected on mobile devices. For example, &lt;div class=\"table-wrapper\" markdown=\"block\"&gt; |title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8| |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8| |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8| |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8| |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8| &lt;/div&gt; Will be rendered as title1 title2 title3 title4 title5 title6 title7 title8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5. Diagrams with mermaid.js This jekyll-theme supports mermaid.js to render diagrams in markdown. To enable the mermaid support, you need to set mermaid: true in the front matter of your post. --- mermaid: true --- The example can be previewed at: https://sighingnow.github.io/jekyll-gitbook/jekyll/2023-08-31-mermaid.html 6. Footnotes e.g., The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was proved to be invalid for other exponents[^1]. Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions: $$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$ The well known Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ was proved to be invalid for other exponents1. Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions: \\[x^n + y^n = z^n\\] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem &#8617;"
