# 🎵 Sound Setup
**Time: 1 hour** | **Role: sound**

> **Your Priorities:**
> - Protect hearing – be ready to mute at any moment
> - Minimise distractions – create a smooth worship experience

## 3. Startup
**Time: 5 mins**

- [ ] Get some tunes going for setup teams
  - [ ] Connect to Bluetooth (Logitech Adapter)
  - [ ] Play whatever you like, but remember it's a church building 😉
- [ ] Check & change batteries

  - [ ] Teaching headset mic
  - [ ] Laptop clicker
  - [ ] 5x In-ear packs (IEMs)
  - [ ] Put gear out on large flat laptop stand

## 4. Line Check
**Time: 15 mins**

> Purpose: make sure every input is connected and producing signal before mixing.

- [ ] Remind band to not put IEMs in until after line check is complete
  > This is because you're changing channel gains, which will affect what goes to the IEMs
- [ ] Load preset "Reset"
- [ ] For each instrument
  - [ ] Adjust the gain so it's in the low-orange (red is too high, green is ok too)
  > If there's limited/no signal, check the following: the instrument is producing signal, cables from instrument through to box all OK, DI boxes have power and are not reducing gain, channel mute isn't active, a high gate has not been added by accident.

## 5. Sound Check
**Time: 25 mins**
> ⚠️ Warning! All gain and EQ changes are heard in band members' in-ears - be sure to warn the band before making significant changes!
- [ ] Grab a microphone so you can talk to the band, and ensure it is being sent to all in-ears
- [ ] Tell the band it's now okay to put in their in-ears
- [ ] Un-mute DCAs (last iPad tab) and set to 0dB
- [ ] Un-mute Master (penultimate tab) and set to 0dB
- [ ] For each instrument
  - [ ] Volume – bring up main fader
  - [ ] EQ – make it sound good by reduction of frequencies (not by boosting them)
  - [ ] Feedback – if you get feedback, turn up the volume to find the frequency, then put a big dip at that frequency (make it as narrow as possible)
  - [ ] Dynamics – don't touch gate or compression unless you know what you're doing

## 6. Pre-Service Readiness
**Time: 15 mins**
- [ ] 10:40 - Play the [Pre-service Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6eFHoqPnNc89xkq8eM78Bj) either from your mobile (bluetooth) or laptop (ask the visuals person)
