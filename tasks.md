# 🎵 Sound Setup
**Time: 09:00 - 09:45** | **Role: sound**

> **Your Priorities:**
> - Protect hearing – be ready to mute at any moment
> - Minimise distractions – create a smooth worship experience

## Getting started
**Time: 5 mins**
- [ ] Check/change batteries & put gear on a laptop stand
  - [ ] Microphones (2x vocals, 1x host)
  - [ ] Preaching headset
  - [ ] Laptop clicker
  - [ ] In-ear packs (5x)
     
## Line Check
**Time: 15 mins**

> Line check is not about getting sound out of the main speakers and making it sound good; it's simply about ensuring you are getting signal into every channel correctly, and at the right level.

- [ ] Remind band to not put IEMs in until after line check is complete
  > This is because you're changing channel gains, which will affect what goes to the IEMs
- [ ] Load preset "Reset"
- [ ] Set gain for each instrument
  - [ ] Un-mute each channel
  - [ ] Adjust gain so it's in the low-orange (red is too high, green is ok too)
  > If there's limited/no signal, check the following: the instrument is producing signal, cables from instrument through to box all OK, DI boxes have power and are not reducing gain, channel mute isn't active, a high gate has not been added by accident.

## Sound Check
**Time: 25 mins**

> Now comes the fun part! Sound check is where your job is to "make them sound good" out of the main speakers.

- [ ] Grab a microphone so you can talk to the band, and ensure it is being sent to all in-ears
- [ ] Tell the band it's now okay to put in their in-ears
- [ ] Un-mute DCAs (last iPad tab) and set to 0dB
- [ ] Un-mute Master (penultimate tab) and set to 0dB
- [ ] Go through each band member
  - [ ] Volume – bring up main fader
  - [ ] EQ – make it sound good by reduction of frequencies (not by boosting them)
    > ⚠️ Changing gain/EQ affects in-ears - warn band before making significant changes!

## Getting ready for the service
- [ ] Play the [Pre-service Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6eFHoqPnNc89xkq8eM78Bj) either on your mobile (bluetooth) or via the laptop (ask the visuals person)
- [ ] 10:45 - Make sure the preacher has their microphone setup properly and knows how to use it (power + mute)
- [ ] 10:55 - Be ready for announcements via host microphone (slightly quieten music behind)
- [ ] 11:00 - Gradually fade the music out when host starts opening
- [ ] After talk - Fade in a quiet a [no-vocals worship playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7dqiLIfuehHZvHQdHoHEaF)
